# Bank-Marketing-model
The banks consume a lot of money and time in the marketing campaigns so if thereâ€™s a model can predict accurately whether the customer will subscribe or not, then banks will save a lot of effort, money and time as then they can know better what can raise the probability of customer subscription and the campaigns will be more targeted for persons that are more likely to subscribe which can save more and more money and time.
